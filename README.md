# Caesar Cipher Implementation
Your task in this homework is to construct a class to implement Caesar Cipher
## Specification
### __init__() method
Define attributes that may be used in the following methods, such as key. 

### Encrypt Message
The objective of the `encrypt()` method is to encrypt a message using Caesar Cipher. The method should return the encrypted message.

Started function:

```python

def encrypt(self, plaintext):
    ''' 
    Task 1: encrypt plaintext using caesar cipher
    '''

    return True
```
### Decript Message
The objective of the `decrypt()` method is to decrypt a encrypted message using Caesar Cipher. The method should return the decrypted message.

Started function:

```python

def decrypt(self, ciphertext):
    ''' 
    Task 2: decrypt ciphertext using caesar cipher
    '''

    return True
```

### Encrypt a File
The objective of the `encrypt_file()` method is to encrypt the content in a file using Caesar Cipher and then write the encrypted content in another file. 

Started function:

```python

def encrypt_file(self, input_filename, output_filename):
    '''
    Task 3: encrypt the content in a file (input_filename) using caesar cipher 
            and store the ciphertext in another file (output_filename)
    '''

    pass
```

### Decrypt a file
The objective of the `decrypt_file()` method is to decrypt the content in a file using Caesar Cipher and then write the decrypted content in another file. 

Starter function:

```python

def decrypt_file(self, input_filename, output_filename):
    '''
    Task 4: decrypt the content in a file (input_filename) using caesar cipher 
            and store the decrypted text in another file (output_filename)
    '''

    pass
```
